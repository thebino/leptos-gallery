Showing a grid of photos with an authentication to select different albums with an ALBUMCODE and a PASSCODE acting as secret.
This application uses Server-Side Rendering manipulating the DOM.

## üå± Usage

Define the _root_path_ and an _admin secret_ in the config.
> The admin secret is only required for the start of the application.

```toml
root_dir = "./public/"
secret = "secret"
```

Manage albums via these endpoints:

- `POST /album` to create a new album - returns `201 - location /album/ABCD1234`
- `POST /album/ABCD1234` - to add new items to an album
- `DELETE /album/ABCD1234` - to delete an album - returns `204 No Content`
- `DELETE /album/ABCD1234/f80d31b6-8193-40a4-92ff-fcc6b1f6f284` - to delete an item from the album

All these endpoints need an Authentication header containing the admin secret: `Authentication: secret`
